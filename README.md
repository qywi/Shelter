# ​ Shelter

**Shelter** is my second website — an animal shelter front-end project created during the **JavaScript Front-End Pre-School** course (2024 Q2) at **Rolling Scopes School**.

This project showcases a responsive multi-section site for a fictional shelter called **“Cozy House”**, featuring information about available pets, shelter mission, success stories, volunteer opportunities, and contact details.

## ​ Features

- **About Section** — “Cozy House” currently cares for 121 dogs and 342 cats, with only 20 % expected to find homes; the rest stay until their forever family finds them.  
- **Pet Listings** — Browse lists of available dogs and cats (with placeholder content).
- **Mission & Stats** — Emphasizes shelter’s mission to improve adoption outcomes and highlights key statistics.
- **Volunteer & Donate** — Sections encouraging visitors to get involved (volunteering or donating).
- **Contact & Hours** — Provides information on how to reach the shelter and when it’s open.
- **Responsive Layout** — Designed to adapt smoothly to both desktop and mobile screens, with mobile-first approach.  
  — Incorporates clean navigation, accessible layout, and clear calls-to-action, aligning with best practices for animal shelter websites :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
